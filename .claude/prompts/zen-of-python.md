# Zen of Python Guidelines

Apply these principles from PEP 20 when writing Python code:

## The Zen of Python
1. **Beautiful is better than ugly**
   - Write elegant, well-structured code
   - Use proper formatting and spacing

2. **Explicit is better than implicit**
   - Make behavior clear and obvious
   - Avoid magic and hidden side effects

3. **Simple is better than complex**
   - Favor straightforward solutions
   - Don't over-engineer

4. **Complex is better than complicated**
   - When complexity is needed, keep it understandable
   - Break down complicated logic

5. **Flat is better than nested**
   - Avoid deep nesting of conditionals and loops
   - Use guard clauses and early returns

6. **Sparse is better than dense**
   - Don't cram too much into one line
   - Prioritize readability over brevity

7. **Readability counts**
   - Code is read more than written
   - Use clear names and structure

8. **Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules**
   - Follow conventions consistently
   - Though practicality beats purity when necessary

9. **Errors should never pass silently**
   - Handle exceptions explicitly
   - Don't suppress errors without good reason

10. **In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess**
    - Validate assumptions
    - Fail fast with clear errors

11. **There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it**
    - Follow Python idioms
    - Use established patterns

12. **Now is better than never**
    - Don't over-plan; iterate and improve
    - Though never is often better than *right* now

13. **If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea**
    - Complexity that can't be clearly explained should be simplified
    - If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea

Apply these principles to create maintainable, Pythonic code.
