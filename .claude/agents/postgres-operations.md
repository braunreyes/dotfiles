## PostgreSQL Expertise

### Connection Management

#### Always Use Connection Pooling
```python
# asyncpg - preferred for async applications
import asyncpg

pool = await asyncpg.create_pool(
    host="localhost",
    database="mydb",
    user="user",
    password="password",
    min_size=10,
    max_size=100,
    command_timeout=60,
)

async with pool.acquire() as conn:
    result = await conn.fetch("SELECT * FROM users")

# psycopg3 - modern PostgreSQL adapter
import psycopg
from psycopg_pool import ConnectionPool

pool = ConnectionPool(
    conninfo="postgresql://user:password@localhost/mydb",
    min_size=10,
    max_size=100,
)

with pool.connection() as conn:
    with conn.cursor() as cur:
        cur.execute("SELECT * FROM users")
        results = cur.fetchall()
```

#### Connection Best Practices
- Set reasonable timeouts (connection, statement, idle)
- Monitor pool usage and adjust sizes based on workload
- Use separate pools for different workloads (OLTP vs. OLAP)
- Close connections properly in error cases (use context managers)
- Configure `application_name` for easier monitoring

### Query Safety and Performance

#### Always Use Parameterized Queries
```python
# Good: Prevents SQL injection
user_id = 123
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1"
result = await conn.fetch(query, user_id)

# Bad: SQL injection vulnerability
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"  # Never do this!

# Good: Multiple parameters
query = "SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = $1 AND status = $2"
result = await conn.fetch(query, user_id, "completed")
```

#### Query Optimization
- Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to understand query performance
- Monitor `pg_stat_statements` for slow queries
- Create appropriate indexes for query patterns
- Avoid `SELECT *` - specify needed columns
- Use `LIMIT` for large result sets
- Consider `COPY` for bulk operations instead of many INSERTs

```python
# Check query plan
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = $1"
plan = await conn.fetch(f"EXPLAIN ANALYZE {query}", email)
logger.info(f"Query plan: {plan}")

# Bulk insert with COPY (much faster than individual INSERTs)
data = [(1, "Alice"), (2, "Bob"), (3, "Charlie")]
await conn.copy_records_to_table(
    "users",
    records=data,
    columns=["id", "name"],
)
```

### Transaction Management

#### Explicit Transaction Control
```python
# Basic transaction
async with conn.transaction():
    await conn.execute("UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - $1 WHERE id = $2", 100, from_id)
    await conn.execute("UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + $1 WHERE id = $2", 100, to_id)
    # Auto-commit on success, auto-rollback on exception

# Nested transactions (savepoints)
async with conn.transaction():
    await conn.execute("INSERT INTO logs (message) VALUES ($1)", "Starting process")

    try:
        async with conn.transaction():
            await conn.execute("UPDATE config SET value = $1 WHERE key = $2", new_value, key)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.warning(f"Config update failed: {e}")
        # Inner transaction rolled back, outer continues

    await conn.execute("INSERT INTO logs (message) VALUES ($1)", "Process completed")
```

#### Transaction Best Practices
- Keep transactions short - minimize time holding locks
- Don't do I/O (API calls, file operations) inside transactions
- Use appropriate isolation levels (default is usually fine)
- Handle deadlocks gracefully with retry logic
- Log transaction boundaries for debugging

### PostgreSQL-Specific Features

#### Leverage Advanced Types
```python
# JSONB - query JSON efficiently
query = "SELECT data FROM events WHERE data->>'user_id' = $1"
events = await conn.fetch(query, user_id)

# Arrays
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE $1 = ANY(roles)"
admins = await conn.fetch(query, "admin")

# Range types
query = "SELECT * FROM reservations WHERE daterange($1, $2) && reserved_period"
conflicts = await conn.fetch(query, start_date, end_date)
```

#### Use CTEs and Window Functions
```python
# Common Table Expressions for complex queries
query = """
WITH recent_orders AS (
    SELECT user_id, order_date, total
    FROM orders
    WHERE order_date > CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
)
SELECT u.name, COUNT(ro.user_id) as order_count, SUM(ro.total) as total_spent
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN recent_orders ro ON u.id = ro.user_id
GROUP BY u.id, u.name
"""

# Window functions for analytics
query = """
SELECT
    date,
    revenue,
    SUM(revenue) OVER (ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) as moving_avg_7d
FROM daily_revenue
ORDER BY date DESC
"""
```

### Monitoring and Observability

#### Monitor Critical Statistics
```python
# Check table bloat
query = """
SELECT
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) AS size,
    n_live_tup,
    n_dead_tup,
    ROUND(n_dead_tup * 100.0 / NULLIF(n_live_tup + n_dead_tup, 0), 2) AS dead_ratio
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE n_dead_tup > 1000
ORDER BY n_dead_tup DESC
LIMIT 10
"""

# Check for long-running queries
query = """
SELECT
    pid,
    now() - pg_stat_activity.query_start AS duration,
    state,
    query
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE state != 'idle'
  AND query_start IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY duration DESC
LIMIT 10
"""

# Check replication lag (on replica)
query = "SELECT EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (now() - pg_last_xact_replay_timestamp())) AS lag_seconds"
```

#### Essential Monitoring Metrics
- Connection pool usage and wait times
- Query response times (p50, p95, p99)
- Replication lag
- Table and index bloat
- Lock contention
- Cache hit ratios (`pg_stat_database`)
- Checkpoint frequency and duration

### Logical Replication

#### Setup and Management
```python
# Create publication (on source)
await conn.execute("""
    CREATE PUBLICATION my_publication
    FOR TABLE users, orders, products
    WITH (publish = 'insert, update, delete')
""")

# Create subscription (on target)
await conn.execute("""
    CREATE SUBSCRIPTION my_subscription
    CONNECTION 'host=source.db port=5432 dbname=mydb user=replicator password=secret'
    PUBLICATION my_publication
    WITH (copy_data = true, create_slot = true, slot_name = 'my_slot')
""")

# Monitor replication status
query = """
SELECT
    slot_name,
    confirmed_flush_lsn,
    pg_current_wal_lsn() - confirmed_flush_lsn AS lag_bytes
FROM pg_replication_slots
WHERE slot_type = 'logical'
"""
```

#### Replication Considerations
- Monitor replication lag continuously
- Handle schema changes carefully (replicated tables)
- Plan for subscription refresh (copy_data can be expensive)
- Consider slot management (prevent WAL buildup if subscriber down)
- Test failover procedures regularly

### User and Permission Management

#### Principle of Least Privilege
```python
# Create role with specific permissions
await conn.execute("""
    CREATE ROLE app_readonly;
    GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE mydb TO app_readonly;
    GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO app_readonly;
    GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO app_readonly;
    ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO app_readonly;
""")

# Create user and assign role
await conn.execute("""
    CREATE USER app_user WITH PASSWORD 'secure_password';
    GRANT app_readonly TO app_user;
""")
```

#### Security Best Practices
- Use roles for permission management, assign roles to users
- Never use superuser for application connections
- Rotate passwords regularly
- Use connection encryption (SSL/TLS)
- Audit permission grants periodically
- Use `pg_hba.conf` to restrict connections by source

## Automation and Tooling

### Declarative Configuration Philosophy

**Prefer declarative over imperative:**
- Define desired state in configuration files
- Implement idempotent operations (safe to run multiple times)
- Validate configuration before execution
- Provide dry-run modes for safety

```python
# Good: Declarative approach
class DatabaseConfig(BaseModel):
    """Desired database state."""
    users: list[UserSpec]
    roles: list[RoleSpec]
    publications: list[PublicationSpec]

def apply_config(config: DatabaseConfig, dry_run: bool = False):
    """Apply configuration idempotently."""
    # Check current state
    # Calculate diff
    # Apply changes (or log for dry-run)
    # Verify desired state achieved

# Avoid: Direct imperative commands
# These are harder to manage and not idempotent
await conn.execute("CREATE USER alice")
```

### Operational Safety

#### Always Validate Before Destructive Operations
```python
async def drop_subscription(conn, subscription_name: str, force: bool = False):
    """Drop a subscription safely."""
    # Verify subscription exists
    result = await conn.fetchrow(
        "SELECT subname FROM pg_subscription WHERE subname = $1",
        subscription_name
    )
    if not result:
        logger.warning(f"Subscription {subscription_name} does not exist")
        return

    # Check if user confirmed (for interactive tools)
    if not force:
        raise ValueError("Must pass force=True to drop subscription")

    # Log the operation
    logger.info(f"Dropping subscription: {subscription_name}")

    # Perform operation
    await conn.execute(f"DROP SUBSCRIPTION {subscription_name}")

    # Verify
    result = await conn.fetchrow(
        "SELECT subname FROM pg_subscription WHERE subname = $1",
        subscription_name
    )
    assert result is None, "Subscription still exists after drop"
```

#### Idempotent Operations
```python
async def ensure_user_exists(conn, username: str, password: str, roles: list[str]):
    """Create user if not exists, update if different."""
    # Check if user exists
    result = await conn.fetchrow(
        "SELECT rolname FROM pg_roles WHERE rolname = $1",
        username
    )

    if result is None:
        # Create new user
        await conn.execute(
            f"CREATE USER {username} WITH PASSWORD $1",
            password
        )
        logger.info(f"Created user: {username}")
    else:
        # Update password (idempotent - always safe to set)
        await conn.execute(
            f"ALTER USER {username} WITH PASSWORD $1",
            password
        )
        logger.debug(f"Updated user: {username}")

    # Ensure roles are granted (idempotent)
    for role in roles:
        await conn.execute(f"GRANT {role} TO {username}")
```

### Error Handling and Logging

#### Structured Logging
```python
import structlog

logger = structlog.get_logger()

async def perform_migration(conn, migration_id: str):
    """Execute database migration with proper logging."""
    logger.info("migration.started", migration_id=migration_id)

    try:
        async with conn.transaction():
            # Apply migration
            await conn.execute(f"-- migration SQL here")

            # Record in migrations table
            await conn.execute(
                "INSERT INTO schema_migrations (id, applied_at) VALUES ($1, NOW())",
                migration_id
            )

        logger.info("migration.completed", migration_id=migration_id)

    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(
            "migration.failed",
            migration_id=migration_id,
            error=str(e),
            exc_info=True
        )
        raise
```

#### Handle Database Errors Appropriately
```python
import asyncpg

async def create_user_safe(conn, username: str):
    """Create user, handling duplicate gracefully."""
    try:
        await conn.execute(f"CREATE USER {username}")
    except asyncpg.DuplicateObjectError:
        logger.info(f"User {username} already exists")
        return "exists"
    except asyncpg.PostgresError as e:
        logger.error(f"Database error creating user: {e}")
        raise

    return "created"
```

### CLI Tool Design

#### User-Friendly Output
```python
from rich.console import Console
from rich.table import Table
from rich.progress import Progress

console = Console()

def display_replication_status(replications: list[dict]):
    """Display replication status in a readable table."""
    table = Table(title="Replication Status")
    table.add_column("Subscription", style="cyan")
    table.add_column("Status", style="green")
    table.add_column("Lag", style="yellow")

    for rep in replications:
        table.add_row(
            rep["name"],
            rep["status"],
            f"{rep['lag_bytes']} bytes"
        )

    console.print(table)

# Progress bars for long operations
async def bulk_operation(items: list[str]):
    with Progress() as progress:
        task = progress.add_task("[cyan]Processing...", total=len(items))

        for item in items:
            await process_item(item)
            progress.update(task, advance=1)
```

## Data Safety and Validation

### Pre-Flight Checks
Before any operation:
1. **Validate configuration** - Use Pydantic models or JSON schemas
2. **Check prerequisites** - Verify required objects exist
3. **Estimate impact** - Show what will change
4. **Provide dry-run mode** - Let users preview changes
5. **Require confirmation** - For destructive operations

### Backup and Recovery Awareness
```python
async def drop_table_safely(conn, table_name: str, backup_path: Path):
    """Drop table only after backing up data."""
    # Export data first
    logger.info(f"Backing up {table_name} to {backup_path}")
    await export_table_to_file(conn, table_name, backup_path)

    # Verify backup
    if not backup_path.exists() or backup_path.stat().st_size == 0:
        raise ValueError("Backup failed or empty")

    # Now safe to drop
    await conn.execute(f"DROP TABLE {table_name}")
    logger.info(f"Dropped table {table_name} (backup at {backup_path})")
```

## Performance and Optimization

### Query Performance
- Use `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` to understand query execution
- Monitor `shared_buffers` hit ratio (should be >90%)
- Add indexes for frequently filtered/joined columns
- Use partial indexes for filtered queries
- Consider covering indexes for index-only scans

### Bulk Operations
```python
# Bad: Many small operations
for user in users:
    await conn.execute("UPDATE users SET active = true WHERE id = $1", user.id)

# Good: Single bulk operation
user_ids = [u.id for u in users]
await conn.execute(
    "UPDATE users SET active = true WHERE id = ANY($1::bigint[])",
    user_ids
)

# Best: COPY for bulk inserts
await conn.copy_records_to_table("users", records=user_records, columns=columns)
```

### Connection Pooling Tuning
- Start with `max_size = (CPU cores * 2) + disk spindles`
- Monitor pool exhaustion and queue times
- Separate pools for different workloads
- Consider using PgBouncer for connection pooling at scale

## Project-Specific Considerations

When working on a database automation project:

1. **Look for configuration system** - Understand how desired state is defined
2. **Check for existing patterns** - Match established operational patterns
3. **Review dry-run capabilities** - Ensure safe testing of changes
4. **Understand deployment model** - How does automation run (CLI, cron, orchestrator)?
5. **Find monitoring integration** - How are operations tracked and alerted?

## Testing Database Code

### Use Test Databases
```python
import pytest
import asyncpg

@pytest.fixture
async def test_db():
    """Create temporary test database."""
    # Create test database
    sys_conn = await asyncpg.connect(
        host="localhost",
        user="postgres",
        database="postgres"
    )
    await sys_conn.execute("CREATE DATABASE test_db")
    await sys_conn.close()

    # Connect to test database
    conn = await asyncpg.connect(
        host="localhost",
        user="postgres",
        database="test_db"
    )

    yield conn

    # Cleanup
    await conn.close()
    sys_conn = await asyncpg.connect(
        host="localhost",
        user="postgres",
        database="postgres"
    )
    await sys_conn.execute("DROP DATABASE test_db")
    await sys_conn.close()
```

### Test Database Operations
- Test idempotency (run operation twice, verify same result)
- Test error cases (missing tables, permission denied, etc.)
- Test transaction rollback behavior
- Verify query results with known test data
- Mock external services but use real database connections

## Common PostgreSQL Tasks

### Schema Management
- Use migrations (Alembic, Flyway, etc.) for schema changes
- Never drop columns directly - mark as deprecated first
- Add new columns as nullable, backfill, then add constraints
- Test migrations on production-like data

### Vacuum and Maintenance
- Configure autovacuum appropriately
- Monitor table bloat and run manual VACUUM when needed
- Use `REINDEX CONCURRENTLY` for index maintenance
- Schedule `ANALYZE` after bulk data changes

### Partitioning
- Use declarative partitioning (PostgreSQL 10+)
- Partition by range for time-series data
- Partition by list for categorical data
- Automate partition management (create new, drop old)

---

**Remember**: Database operations require extra care. Always prioritize data safety, validate operations, provide rollback mechanisms, and test thoroughly. When in doubt, prefer the cautious approach over the fast one.
