## Tool Design Principles

Based on Anthropic's engineering research, great tools for AI agents follow these core principles:

### 1. Quality over Quantity

**Problem**: Too many overlapping tools create confusion and waste context.

**Solution**: Build fewer, more powerful multi-purpose tools.

**Example**:
```
❌ Bad: list_users, list_events, create_event (3 separate tools)
✅ Good: schedule_event (consolidates all scheduling operations)
```

**Guidance**:
- Consolidate related functionality into cohesive tools
- Each tool should serve a clear, distinct purpose
- Reduce total tool count while increasing utility per tool
- Ask: "Could this be a parameter on an existing tool?"

### 2. Namespacing

**Problem**: Similar tools become hard to distinguish.

**Solution**: Group related tools with consistent prefixes.

**Example**:
```
✅ Good namespacing:
  - asana_search, asana_projects_search, asana_users_search
  - github_issues_search, github_repos_search
  - pg_users, pg_metrics, pg_extensions

❌ Poor namespacing:
  - search_asana, projects, get_users (inconsistent, unclear)
```

**Guidance**:
- Use `service_resource_action` pattern
- Keep prefix consistent across related tools
- Make tool relationships immediately obvious
- Group by domain/service first, then resource

### 3. Meaningful Context

**Problem**: Tools returning cryptic IDs or low-signal information.

**Solution**: Return human-readable, high-signal data that aids decision-making.

**Example**:
```python
❌ Bad:
{
  "id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890",  # cryptic UUID
  "status": 2,                  # numeric code
  "data": {...}                 # unclear meaning
}

✅ Good:
{
  "name": "Deploy Production API",  # readable identifier
  "status": "in_progress",          # semantic meaning
  "owner": "Jane Doe",              # human context
  "deadline": "2025-11-15",         # relevant date
  "blockers": ["Waiting for security review"]  # actionable info
}
```

**Guidance**:
- Prioritize names over UUIDs (include both if needed)
- Use semantic values over codes ("active" not `1`)
- Include context that humans use for decisions
- Offer response format options (concise vs. detailed)
- Return only high-signal information

### 4. Token Efficiency

**Problem**: Tools overwhelming Claude with massive, unfocused responses.

**Solution**: Implement pagination, filtering, and smart truncation.

**Example**:
```python
❌ Bad:
def search_all_users():
    """Returns all 50,000 users in the system."""
    return get_all_users()  # 🔥 Burns 100k+ tokens

✅ Good:
def search_users(
    query: str,
    limit: int = 20,
    include_inactive: bool = False
):
    """Search users with filtering and pagination.

    Returns top 20 matches by default. Excludes inactive
    users unless specified. Encourages targeted searches.
    """
    return search_with_filters(query, limit, include_inactive)
```

**Guidance**:
- Default to reasonable limits (10-50 items)
- Provide pagination with `limit` and `offset`
- Support filtering to narrow results
- Truncate large fields (summarize or clip)
- Encourage agents to make targeted queries
- Return helpful errors: "Too many results (5000+), try filtering by..."

### 5. Purpose-Driven Design

**Problem**: Tools that merely wrap APIs without understanding agent workflows.

**Solution**: Design tools that help agents solve tasks like humans would.

**Example**:
```
❌ Bad (API wrapper):
  - http_get("/api/user/123")
  - http_get("/api/user/123/orders")
  - http_get("/api/order/456")
  - http_get("/api/order/456/items")

✅ Good (purpose-driven):
  - get_customer_order_history(customer_id, limit=10)
    → Returns what humans actually need in one call
```

**Guidance**:
- Think: "How would a human accomplish this task?"
- Combine multiple API calls into semantic operations
- Reduce intermediate steps and outputs
- Design for the *task*, not the *API*
- Natural problem-solving strategies over technical plumbing

---

## Tool Design Methodology

### Phase 1: Understand the Need

**Questions to Ask**:
1. What task is the user/agent trying to accomplish?
2. How would a human expert do this task?
3. What information is essential vs. nice-to-have?
4. How often will this tool be used?
5. Is this a new capability or improvement to existing tool?

**Red Flags**:
- "We need to expose this API endpoint" (API-first thinking)
- "The agent needs access to everything" (too broad)
- "Just return all the data" (token inefficient)

**Green Flags**:
- "Agents need to [accomplish specific task]" (task-first)
- "This will reduce 5 tool calls to 1" (consolidation)
- "Humans care about X, not Y" (meaningful context)

### Phase 2: Design the Interface

**Tool Signature**:
```python
def tool_name(
    # Required parameters (clear purpose)
    required_param: str,

    # Optional parameters (sensible defaults)
    limit: int = 20,
    include_details: bool = False,
    format: Literal["concise", "detailed"] = "concise"
) -> dict:
    """Brief, clear description of what this accomplishes.

    Parameters:
        required_param: What this represents and why it's needed
        limit: Default 20, max 100. Pagination for large results
        include_details: False for summaries, True for full data
        format: Response format - concise for listings, detailed for single item

    Returns:
        High-signal information in human-readable format

    Examples:
        # Common use case
        result = tool_name("example")

        # Power user with options
        result = tool_name("example", limit=50, format="detailed")
    """
```

**Design Checklist**:
- [ ] Tool name is clear and descriptive
- [ ] Parameters have sensible defaults
- [ ] Supports pagination/filtering
- [ ] Returns meaningful context (names, not just IDs)
- [ ] Docstring includes examples
- [ ] One tool = one clear purpose

### Phase 3: Design the Response

**Response Structure**:
```python
{
    # Status (success, partial, error)
    "status": "success",

    # Summary (high-level overview)
    "summary": "Found 3 active projects matching 'API'",

    # Data (actual results, token-efficient)
    "results": [
        {
            "name": "API Gateway",           # Human-readable
            "id": "proj-123",                # Technical ID (if needed)
            "status": "in_progress",         # Semantic value
            "owner": "Engineering Team",     # Context
            "last_updated": "2025-10-15",    # Relevant date
            "priority": "high"               # Actionable info
        }
        # ... more results (paginated)
    ],

    # Metadata (helps agent decide next action)
    "total_count": 47,
    "showing": 3,
    "next_actions": [
        "Use limit parameter to see more results",
        "Filter by status or priority to narrow down"
    ]
}
```

**Response Checklist**:
- [ ] Includes human-readable identifiers
- [ ] Semantic values over codes
- [ ] High-signal information only
- [ ] Helpful metadata (counts, suggestions)
- [ ] Token-efficient (not dumping everything)

### Phase 4: Consider Error Handling

**Error Response Pattern**:
```python
{
    "status": "error",
    "error": "Search returned too many results (5,247 items)",
    "suggestion": "Try adding filters: status='active' or owner='team_name'",
    "available_filters": ["status", "owner", "priority", "date_range"]
}
```

**Error Guidance**:
- Helpful, not cryptic errors
- Suggest specific next actions
- Guide agents toward better queries
- Don't fail silently

---

## Tool Evaluation Framework

Use this framework to evaluate existing tools:

### Evaluation Checklist

**Quality over Quantity**:
- [ ] Could this be combined with another tool?
- [ ] Does this overlap with existing functionality?
- [ ] Is the tool count reasonable (<20 total)?

**Namespacing**:
- [ ] Clear, consistent naming convention?
- [ ] Related tools grouped with common prefix?
- [ ] Easy to distinguish similar tools?

**Meaningful Context**:
- [ ] Returns human-readable identifiers?
- [ ] Uses semantic values (not codes)?
- [ ] Includes decision-relevant context?
- [ ] Offers response format options?

**Token Efficiency**:
- [ ] Supports pagination (limit/offset)?
- [ ] Supports filtering?
- [ ] Reasonable default limits?
- [ ] Truncates large fields?
- [ ] Helpful error guidance?

**Purpose-Driven**:
- [ ] Solves task like human would?
- [ ] Reduces intermediate steps?
- [ ] More than just API wrapper?
- [ ] Natural problem-solving flow?

### Rating System

For each tool, provide:
- **Score**: 1-5 (1 = poor, 5 = excellent)
- **Strengths**: What works well
- **Issues**: What needs improvement
- **Recommendations**: Specific, actionable changes
- **Priority**: High/Medium/Low urgency

---

## MCP Tool Design

When designing tools for Model Context Protocol servers:

### MCP Tool Template

```json
{
  "name": "service_resource_action",
  "description": "Clear, concise description of what this accomplishes",
  "inputSchema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "required_param": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "What this represents and why it's needed"
      },
      "limit": {
        "type": "integer",
        "description": "Maximum results to return (default: 20, max: 100)",
        "default": 20,
        "minimum": 1,
        "maximum": 100
      },
      "format": {
        "type": "string",
        "enum": ["concise", "detailed"],
        "description": "Response detail level",
        "default": "concise"
      }
    },
    "required": ["required_param"]
  }
}
```

### MCP Best Practices

1. **Consolidate Related Operations**:
   ```
   Instead of: github_list_issues, github_create_issue, github_update_issue
   Use: github_issues (with action parameter: list/create/update)
   ```

2. **Smart Defaults**:
   - Pagination defaults to 20-50 items
   - Boolean flags default to most common case
   - Format defaults to "concise"

3. **Rich Schemas**:
   - Use `enum` for constrained values
   - Provide min/max for numbers
   - Clear descriptions for every parameter

4. **Response Consistency**:
   - All tools return similar structure
   - Status, summary, results, metadata pattern
   - Predictable error format

## Slash Command Design

When designing slash commands (not MCP tools):

### Command vs. Agent Decision

**Create a Command when**:
- Specific, repeatable workflow
- Structured output needed
- Combines multiple tool calls
- Quick access to common task
- Sequential steps with clear order

**Create an Agent when**:
- Deep expertise needed
- Iterative, consultative work
- Multiple valid approaches
- Learning/teaching component
- Complex decision-making

**Example**:
- `/analyze-tools` (command) → Quick health check
- `@agents/tool-designer.md` (agent) → Design new tools

### Command Structure for Tools

```markdown
---
description: Analyze current tooling and suggest improvements
---

Evaluate all slash commands and agents against Anthropic's tool design principles.

## Step 1: Inventory Current Tools

List all:
- Slash commands in ~/.claude/commands/
- Agents in ~/.claude/agents/
- Group by category/namespace

## Step 2: Evaluate Against Principles

For each tool, assess:
- Quality over quantity (overlaps?)
- Namespacing (clear grouping?)
- Meaningful context (what it returns)
- Token efficiency (pagination, limits?)
- Purpose-driven (solves task vs. wraps API)

## Step 3: Identify Issues

**Redundancies**: Tools that overlap
**Gaps**: Missing capabilities
**Low Quality**: Tools violating principles
**Quick Wins**: Easy improvements

## Step 4: Provide Recommendations

Format:
```markdown
# Tool Analysis Report

## Summary
[High-level findings]

## Current Tooling
[List by category]

## Issues Found
### High Priority
- [Issue 1 with specific recommendation]

### Medium Priority
- [Issue 2 with recommendation]

## Quick Wins
- [Easy improvements]

## Gaps to Fill
- [Missing capabilities]

## Next Actions
1. [Prioritized action]
2. [Next action]
```

## Integration with Other Agents

**Works with**:

- **`@agents/software-planner.md`** - For overall architecture context when designing tool ecosystems
- **`@agents/python-professional.md`** - For implementing MCP servers or tool logic
- **`@agents/technical-writer.md`** - For documenting tools and creating user guides
- **`@agents/development-chronicler.md`** - For documenting tool design decisions

**Example Workflow**:
```
1. @agents/tool-designer.md - Design new MCP tool for GitHub integration
2. @agents/python-professional.md - Implement the MCP server
3. @agents/technical-writer.md - Document the tool for users
4. @agents/development-chronicler.md - Record design rationale
```

---

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Consolidating Similar Tools

**Before**:
```
/pg-users - List PostgreSQL users
/pg-metrics - Show PostgreSQL metrics
/pg-extensions - List installed extensions
/pg-replication - Check replication status
/pg-cron - Manage pg_cron jobs
```

**Analysis**: Related but separate. Could be overwhelming.

**Recommendation**: Consider consolidating:
```
/pg-admin [resource] [action]
  - pg-admin users list
  - pg-admin metrics show
  - pg-admin extensions list

OR keep as-is if each tool is frequently used independently.
```

### Pattern 2: Adding Pagination to Existing Tool

**Before**:
```python
def list_all_projects():
    """Returns all projects."""
    return database.query("SELECT * FROM projects")
```

**After**:
```python
def list_projects(
    limit: int = 20,
    offset: int = 0,
    status: str | None = None
):
    """List projects with pagination and filtering.

    Args:
        limit: Max results (default 20, max 100)
        offset: Skip this many results (for pagination)
        status: Filter by status (active, archived, etc.)
    """
    query = "SELECT * FROM projects"
    if status:
        query += f" WHERE status = '{status}'"
    query += f" LIMIT {min(limit, 100)} OFFSET {offset}"
    return database.query(query)
```

### Pattern 3: Improving Response Context

**Before**:
```python
{
    "user_id": "u_1234567890",
    "status": 2,
    "role": "R_ADMIN"
}
```

**After**:
```python
{
    "name": "Jane Doe",              # Human-readable
    "user_id": "u_1234567890",       # Still available
    "email": "jane@example.com",     # Contact info
    "status": "active",              # Semantic
    "role": "Administrator",         # Clear meaning
    "last_login": "2025-10-28",     # Relevant context
    "team": "Engineering"            # Organizational context
}
```

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: GitHub Integration

**Bad Design**:
```python
github_http_get(endpoint: str)
github_http_post(endpoint: str, data: dict)
```
❌ Just wraps API, agent must know GitHub API structure

**Good Design**:
```python
github_search_issues(
    repo: str,
    query: str,
    state: str = "open",
    limit: int = 20
) -> dict:
    """Search issues in a repository.

    Returns issue title, number, author, labels (high-signal info).
    Automatically handles pagination and rate limits.
    """
```
✅ Purpose-driven, meaningful context, token-efficient

### Example 2: Database Management

**Bad Design**:
```
/run-sql [query]  # Raw SQL execution
```
❌ Unsafe, requires SQL knowledge, no guidance

**Good Design**:
```python
/pg-analyze [table_name] [--slow-queries] [--unused-indexes]
```
✅ Safe operations, guided by purpose, helpful output

### Example 3: Feature Planning

**Bad Design**:
```
/todo - Create todo list
/plan - Create plan
/brainstorm - Brainstorm ideas
```
❌ Three overlapping tools for planning

**Good Design**:
```
/plan-feature - Comprehensive planning workflow
  → Combines requirements, brainstorming, task breakdown
```
✅ Consolidated, purpose-driven, reduces tool count

**Remember**: Great tools are invisible. They help agents accomplish tasks naturally, without fighting the interface. Design tools that feel like extensions of human problem-solving, not obstacles to overcome.

Focus on the task, not the API. Think like a human, build for an agent.
