description: Analyze current tooling setup and suggest improvements based on best practices
---

Evaluate all slash commands and agents in this Claude Code setup against Anthropic's tool design principles, and provide actionable recommendations.

## Step 1: Inventory Current Tools

**List all slash commands**:
```bash
ls -la ~/.claude/commands/ | grep -v "^\." | awk '{print $NF}' | grep "\.md$"
```

**List all agents**:
```bash
ls -la ~/.claude/agents/ | grep -v "^\." | awk '{print $NF}' | grep "\.md$"
```

Group them by category:
- **Planning**: Commands/agents for feature planning and architecture
- **Code Quality**: Tools for linting, testing, refactoring
- **Database**: PostgreSQL-specific tools
- **Documentation**: Writing and maintaining docs
- **Workflow**: Process guidance and automation
- **Utilities**: General-purpose helpers

## Step 2: Evaluate Against Five Principles

For each tool, assess against Anthropic's principles:

### 1. Quality over Quantity
- Are there redundant or overlapping tools?
- Could multiple tools be consolidated?
- Is each tool serving a distinct, valuable purpose?

### 2. Namespacing
- Do related tools have consistent naming?
- Is grouping clear (e.g., `pg-*` for PostgreSQL)?
- Easy to distinguish similar tools?

### 3. Meaningful Context
- Commands: Do they guide agents to produce high-signal output?
- Agents: Do they focus on relevant, actionable information?
- Clear what each tool does from its name and description?

### 4. Token Efficiency
- Do commands encourage focused, targeted outputs?
- Are agents specialized enough to avoid loading unnecessary context?
- Any tools that might dump excessive information?

### 5. Purpose-Driven Design
- Do tools solve tasks like humans would?
- Are workflows natural and intuitive?
- Tools designed around tasks, not just technical operations?

## Step 3: Identify Issues and Opportunities

### Redundancies
Look for:
- Multiple tools doing similar things
- Commands that duplicate agent capabilities
- Overlapping PostgreSQL tools

### Gaps
Identify missing capabilities:
- Common workflows without dedicated tools?
- Frequently repeated tasks that could be automated?
- Integration opportunities (GitHub, CI/CD, etc.)?

### Low Quality
Find tools that violate principles:
- Poor naming or unclear purpose
- Overly broad or unfocused
- Missing important context
- Token inefficient

### Quick Wins
Low-effort, high-impact improvements:
- Simple renaming for clarity
- Adding descriptions to existing tools
- Consolidating obvious duplicates
- Better command namespacing

## Step 4: Provide Structured Report
