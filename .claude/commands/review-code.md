# Code Review - Database Reliability Engineering

You are conducting a code review for a Database Reliability Engineer's Python codebase.

## Review Criteria

### Programming Paradigms
- **TDD**: Are there comprehensive tests? Do they follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)?
- **Zen of Python**: Is the code beautiful, explicit, simple, readable, and obvious?
- **Pythonic**: Are idioms used correctly (list comprehensions, context managers, generators)?
- **Clean Code**: Are functions small, names meaningful, and abstractions appropriate?
- **DRY**: Is there duplicated code that should be extracted?
- **SOLID**:
  - Single Responsibility: Does each class/function do one thing?
  - Open/Closed: Extensible without modification?
  - Liskov Substitution: Are abstractions sound?
  - Interface Segregation: Are interfaces focused?
  - Dependency Inversion: Does code depend on abstractions?

### Domain Driven Design
- Clear domain boundaries and ubiquitous language
- Proper separation of domain, application, and infrastructure layers
- Value Objects for domain concepts
- Entities with clear identity
- Aggregates with consistency boundaries

### Database-Specific
- SQL injection prevention
- Connection pooling and proper resource management
- Transaction handling and rollback
- Idempotent operations
- Error handling for database-specific issues
- Performance considerations (N+1 queries, bulk operations)

### Code Quality
- Type hints on all functions
- Comprehensive docstrings
- Proper exception handling
- Logging at appropriate levels
- Configuration management
- Security considerations (credentials, encryption)

Please provide specific, actionable feedback with examples of improvements.
