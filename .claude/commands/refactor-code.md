# Refactor Code - Database Reliability Engineering

You are helping a Database Reliability Engineer refactor Python code for better design and maintainability.

## Refactoring Principles
- Follow the Boy Scout Rule: leave code better than you found it
- Apply SOLID principles
- Eliminate code smells (long functions, large classes, duplicated code)
- Improve naming and readability
- Enhance testability

## Refactoring Checklist
1. **Extract Method**: Break down large functions
2. **Extract Class**: Split classes with multiple responsibilities
3. **Introduce Parameter Object**: Group related parameters
4. **Replace Conditional with Polymorphism**: Use Strategy or State patterns
5. **Remove Duplication**: Apply DRY principle
6. **Improve Names**: Use ubiquitous language from DDD
7. **Add Type Hints**: Improve type safety
8. **Simplify Conditionals**: Make logic more readable

## Database-Specific Refactorings
- Extract SQL queries to dedicated modules or query builders
- Introduce Repository Pattern for database access
- Create Value Objects for database entities
- Implement connection pooling
- Add proper transaction boundaries

## Process
1. Ensure existing tests pass
2. Add tests if coverage is insufficient
3. Refactor in small, safe steps
4. Run tests after each change
5. Commit frequently

Preserve existing functionality while improving code structure and design.
