# Advanced Claude Instructions

This document defines how Claude should approach software development tasks in this workspace, emphasizing thoughtful planning, proactive quality assurance, clear communication, and respect for project conventions.

## Core Principles

### 1. Think Before You Code

**Plan First**
- Before starting any non-trivial task, break it down into clear steps
- Use the TodoWrite tool to track multi-step tasks
- Consider edge cases, dependencies, and potential issues upfront
- Ask clarifying questions if requirements are ambiguous

**Understand the Context**
- Read existing code to understand patterns and conventions
- Check for similar implementations in the codebase
- Respect the project's architectural decisions
- Follow established naming conventions and code style

### 2. Quality is Non-Negotiable

**Testing is Essential**
- Write tests for all production code (not just exploratory prototypes)
- Tests should be comprehensive: happy path, edge cases, error conditions
- Run tests and verify they pass before marking work complete
- Leverage `@agents/pytest-expert.md` for complex testing scenarios

**Code Standards**
- Follow language-specific best practices
- Write self-documenting code with clear names
- Add comments only when explaining "why", not "what"
- Keep functions focused and modules cohesive

### 3. Communicate Clearly

**Explain Your Reasoning**
- Don't just make changes—explain why you're making them
- Provide context for decisions and trade-offs
- Summarize what changed and why after completing tasks
- Surface risks, blockers, or concerns proactively

**Right Level of Detail**
- Be concise but complete
- Use structured formats for status updates and summaries
- Provide file paths and line numbers when referencing code
- Use markdown formatting for clarity

---

## Project Standards

This project follows specific standards and paradigms. All code must adhere to these requirements.

### Testing Requirements

**Framework and Coverage**
- Use **pytest** as the testing framework
- Maintain **80% minimum code coverage** for all production code
- Always include **integration tests** in addition to unit tests
- Use **testcontainers** for PostgreSQL integration tests (spin up real database instances)

**Testing Philosophy**
- Follow **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** where appropriate
- Write tests alongside implementation, not after
- Tests must cover: happy path, edge cases, error conditions
- Integration tests must use real dependencies (database, external services) via testcontainers
- Use `@agents/pytest-expert.md` for complex testing scenarios

### Code Quality Standards

All production code must meet these standards:

**Type Hints** (Enforced)
- All functions must have type hints for parameters and return values
- Use modern Python 3.9+ type syntax: `list[str]`, `dict[str, int]`, `tuple[int, ...]`
- Use `typing.Optional[T]` or `T | None` for nullable types
- Complex types should be defined as TypeAlias or Pydantic models

**Docstrings** (Enforced)
- All public functions, classes, and modules must have docstrings
- Use Google-style docstrings (consistent with technical-writer agent)
- Include: brief description, Args, Returns, Raises sections
- Example:
  ```python
  def process_order(order_id: int, validate: bool = True) -> Order:
      """Process an order by ID with optional validation.

      Args:
          order_id: The unique identifier for the order
          validate: Whether to run validation checks

      Returns:
          The processed Order object

      Raises:
          OrderNotFoundError: If order_id doesn't exist
          ValidationError: If validation fails
      """
  ```

**Function Size and Complexity**
- Maximum function length: **50 lines**
- Maximum cyclomatic complexity: **10**
- If a function exceeds these limits, refactor into smaller functions
- Use `/find-refactor-candidates` command to identify violations

**Code Formatting and Linting**
- Run `ruff format .` before committing (auto-format code)
- Run `ruff check --fix .` before committing (auto-fix linting issues)
- Run `mypy src/` to verify type hints are correct
- All checks must pass before code is considered complete

### Programming Paradigms

This project follows these core principles:

1. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
   - Write tests first when appropriate
   - Red → Green → Refactor cycle
   - Tests guide design

2. **Clean Code**
   - Self-documenting code with clear names
   - Single Responsibility Principle
   - Boy Scout Rule: leave code better than you found it

3. **SOLID Principles**
   - **S**ingle Responsibility: One reason to change
   - **O**pen/Closed: Open for extension, closed for modification
   - **L**iskov Substitution: Subtypes must be substitutable
   - **I**nterface Segregation: Many specific interfaces > one general
   - **D**ependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

4. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
   - Extract duplicated logic to reusable functions
   - Use inheritance, composition, or mixins for shared behavior
   - BUT: Avoid premature abstraction—two instances isn't duplication yet

5. **Domain-Driven Design**
   - Model business domain explicitly
   - Use ubiquitous language (same terms as domain experts)
   - Organize code around domain concepts, not technical layers

6. **Pythonic Code**
   - Use list/dict comprehensions where appropriate
   - Context managers (`with` statements) for resources
   - Generators for large datasets
   - Follow PEP 8 and modern Python idioms

### Git Workflow Requirements

**Pre-Commit Requirements**
- Tests are **required** before any commit
- All pre-commit hooks must pass:
  1. `ruff format .` - Format code
  2. `ruff check --fix .` - Fix auto-fixable linting issues
  3. `mypy src/` - Type check passes
  4. `pytest` - All tests pass

**Commit Standards**
- Only commit when explicitly asked by the user
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages following project style
- Include what changed and why
- Reference issue numbers if applicable

**Quality Gates**
- Code cannot be merged unless:
  - All tests pass (including integration tests)
  - Coverage meets 80% threshold
  - No linting errors
  - No type checking errors
  - Pre-commit hooks pass

### PostgreSQL Standards

**Database Context**
- Default PostgreSQL port: **5432**
- Assume PostgreSQL is used for data persistence
- Use `@agents/postgres-operations.md` for schema design and migrations
- Use `@agents/sql-optimizer.md` for query performance

**Preferred Extensions**
When working with PostgreSQL, prefer these extensions when relevant:
- **pg_stat_statements**: Query performance monitoring
- **pg_cron**: Scheduled jobs within database
- **pgvector**: Vector similarity search (for ML/AI features)

**Database Best Practices**
- Use testcontainers for integration tests (real PostgreSQL instance)
- Design migrations with rollback strategies
- Use transactions appropriately
- Define indexes for query performance
- Use connection pooling (asyncpg for Python)

## Workflow Guidelines

### Task Breakdown and Planning

For **simple tasks** (single file, clear requirements):
- Go ahead and execute directly
- Keep the user informed of what you're doing
- No need for formal todo tracking

For **moderate tasks** (multiple steps, some complexity):
- Use TodoWrite to create a task list
- Mark tasks in_progress as you work on them
- Complete tasks immediately when finished
- Keep only ONE task in_progress at a time

For **complex tasks** (architectural changes, multiple components):
1. Start by understanding the full scope
2. Create a comprehensive todo list
3. Ask clarifying questions before proceeding
4. Break down into phases if needed
5. Provide regular status updates

### Working with Code

**Reading Code**
- Use Read tool to understand existing implementations
- Use Grep to find patterns and usage examples
- Use Glob to discover related files
- Never assume—verify by reading actual code

**Writing Code**
- Follow the project's existing patterns
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Keep changes focused and atomic
- Consider backward compatibility

**Testing Code**
- Write tests alongside implementation
- Use `@agents/pytest-expert.md` when you need help with:
  - Complex test scenarios
  - Fixture design
  - Debugging test failures
  - Test organization and structure

### Leveraging Specialist Agents

Know when to delegate to specialist agents for better results:

**For Python/FastAPI Development**
- Use `@agents/python-professional.md` when:
  - Building new Python features or services
  - Need guidance on modern Python patterns (3.9+)
  - Working with async/await patterns
  - Implementing data validation with Pydantic
  - Setting up FastAPI endpoints and middleware

**For Testing**
- Use `@agents/pytest-expert.md` when:
  - Designing comprehensive test suites
  - Working with complex fixtures or mocking
  - Debugging test failures
  - Need pytest best practices
  - Improving test coverage

**For Database Work**
- Use `@agents/postgres-operations.md` when:
  - Designing database schemas
  - Working with migrations
  - PostgreSQL-specific features
  - Database administration tasks

- Use `@agents/sql-optimizer.md` when:
  - Query performance is critical
  - Need to optimize slow queries
  - Designing indexes
  - Analyzing query plans

**For Architectural Decisions**
- Use `@agents/core-engineering.md` when:
  - Making significant architectural decisions
  - Need guidance on design patterns
  - Refactoring for maintainability
  - Establishing code quality standards

### Git and Version Control

**Committing Changes**
- Only commit when explicitly asked by the user
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Explain what changed and why
- Follow the project's commit message style
- Include co-author attribution as specified in system instructions

**Pull Requests**
- Create PRs only when requested
- Write comprehensive PR descriptions
- Include summary of changes and test plan
- Reference related issues if applicable

## Communication Patterns

### Status Updates

Use structured format for progress updates:

```markdown
**Status**: [Brief description of current state]
**Completed**: [What's been done]
**In Progress**: [Current work]
**Next**: [Upcoming tasks]
**Blockers**: [Any issues or dependencies]
```

### Completion Summaries

After finishing a task:

```markdown
**Summary**: [What was accomplished]
**Changes**:
- [File/component changed and why]
- [File/component changed and why]

**Testing**: [Test coverage added/verified]
**Notes**: [Anything important to know]
```

### Asking Questions

When requirements are unclear:

```markdown
I need clarification on [topic] before proceeding:

1. [Specific question about requirement]
2. [Question about approach or trade-off]
3. [Question about constraints or preferences]

This will help me [explain why these answers matter].
```

## Quality Gates

Before marking any task as complete, verify:

- ✅ **Functionality**: Code works as intended
- ✅ **Tests**: Comprehensive tests written and passing
- ✅ **Standards**: Follows project conventions and style
- ✅ **Documentation**: Code is clear; complex logic is documented
- ✅ **Edge Cases**: Error conditions and boundaries handled
- ✅ **No Regressions**: Existing functionality still works

## Project-Specific Adaptation

When starting work in a new project:

1. **Read Project Documentation**
   - Look for README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, docs/
   - Understand project structure and goals
   - Note any specific requirements or conventions

2. **Understand Existing Patterns**
   - Review similar existing code
   - Identify naming conventions
   - Note testing patterns
   - Understand error handling approaches

3. **Check Build and Quality Tools**
   - Look for pyproject.toml, package.json, etc.
   - Identify linters and formatters in use
   - Understand CI/CD requirements
   - Note any pre-commit hooks

4. **Respect Established Decisions**
   - Follow the project's architectural patterns
   - Use the same libraries and frameworks
   - Match the existing code organization
   - When suggesting changes, explain rationale

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Don't:**
- ❌ Make assumptions about requirements—ask if unclear
- ❌ Skip testing for "quick fixes"
- ❌ Create new files when editing existing ones would work
- ❌ Commit changes without being asked
- ❌ Proceed when blocked—communicate the issue
- ❌ Make large changes without explaining the plan
- ❌ Ignore existing project patterns in favor of personal preferences
- ❌ Mark tasks complete when they're not fully done

**Do:**
- ✅ Ask clarifying questions early
- ✅ Write tests alongside implementation
- ✅ Prefer editing over creating new files
- ✅ Wait for explicit commit requests
- ✅ Surface blockers immediately
- ✅ Explain your approach before major changes
- ✅ Follow and respect existing conventions
- ✅ Only mark tasks complete when fully finished

## Working with Different Project Types

### Python/FastAPI Services

For Python projects:
1. Follow `@agents/python-professional.md` standards
2. Use modern Python (3.9+) features: type hints, dataclasses, etc.
3. Leverage async/await for I/O operations
4. Write comprehensive pytest tests
5. Use Pydantic for data validation
6. Follow PEP 8 and project's linting config

### Database-Heavy Projects

For projects with significant database work:
1. Design schema changes carefully
2. Plan migrations with rollback strategies
3. Use `@agents/postgres-operations.md` for PostgreSQL specifics
4. Use `@agents/sql-optimizer.md` for performance-critical queries
5. Test database interactions thoroughly
6. Consider data integrity and constraints

### API Development

For REST API projects:
1. Design clear, consistent endpoints
2. Use proper HTTP methods and status codes
3. Validate inputs thoroughly
4. Document API contracts (OpenAPI/Swagger)
5. Handle errors gracefully with meaningful messages
6. Consider versioning strategy

## Decision Framework

### When to Ask Questions

Ask when:
- Requirements are ambiguous or incomplete
- Multiple valid approaches exist with trade-offs
- The request contradicts existing patterns
- You need to know user preferences
- The scope is unclear or seems very large

### When to Just Do It

Proceed directly when:
- Requirements are crystal clear
- The approach is obvious and standard
- It's a simple, low-risk change
- Following established patterns
- It's a bug fix with clear root cause

### When to Break Down the Work

Create a todo list when:
- Task has 3+ distinct steps
- Multiple files/components involved
- Dependencies between subtasks
- Task will take significant time
- User provides a list of items to do

## Continuous Improvement

### Learning from the Project

As you work:
- Note patterns that work well
- Identify pain points or tech debt
- Learn from code review feedback (if any)
- Suggest improvements when appropriate
- Ask about conventions if unsure

### When to Suggest Changes

Suggest improvements when:
- You see clear opportunities for better quality
- Current approach has significant issues
- You have expertise that could help (via specialist agents)
- Trade-offs are worth discussing

But remember:
- Shipping working code > theoretical perfection
- Balance improvement with delivery
- Respect that "different" isn't always "better"
- Technical debt is acceptable if tracked

## Quick Reference

### Starting a New Task

1. Understand requirements (ask if unclear)
2. Plan approach (todo list for complex tasks)
3. Check existing patterns
4. Execute with quality focus
5. Test thoroughly
6. Summarize what you did

### Delegating to an Agent

When a task aligns with a specialist agent's expertise:

```
I'm going to leverage @agents/[agent-name].md for this task because [reason].

@agents/[agent-name].md, please [specific request with context and requirements].
```

### Running Into Issues

When blocked:
1. Clearly explain the problem
2. Share what you've tried
3. Provide error messages and context
4. Ask specific questions
5. Suggest possible solutions if you have ideas

### Completing Work

Before saying "done":
1. Verify all functionality works
2. Ensure tests pass
3. Review code quality
4. Provide clear summary
5. Note any follow-up items
